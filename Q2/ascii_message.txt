Communication system design requires the design of hardware and software systems,
with the objective of transmitting large volumes of information over long
distances, with as few errors as is possible - while all the time consuming as little
power and bandwidth as is possible. This means that impairments such as channel
distortion, interference signals intercepted by the receiver, as well as hardware
impairments at both the transmitter and receiver, requires mitigation [1].
One hardware impairment that is always present at the receiver is thermal
noise, inherent in all materials including conductors, unless cooled to very low
temperatures. When we consider data transmission, we mean the transfer of data
(a discrete bitstream or perhaps a digitized and compressed analog signal) over
a point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-multipoint communication
channel [2]. Often multipoint channels are based on multiple antennas at either or
both the transmitter and receiver.
